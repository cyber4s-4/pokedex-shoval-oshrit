# pokedex-shoval-oshrit
We chose TypeScript for both sides because we wanted to work with a gulp file and practice the material we learned practically.
We compiled the client side and the server side with the gulp file into separate folders using the env file to take information from our Database.
By using the API for all the Pokemons, we wrote a script that runs once and places all the objects in a convenient way for rendering to the client's computer.
In addition, as part of the task, the script included a code that performed a "union" between different Pokemon (
  There was a part in the script that made sure that no pokemon was repeated) so we ended up with 90,000 pokemons.
We started using PostgreSQL as our database. Later, we learned MongoDB and realized it was more efficient and useful to store the information as an object rather than a table.
